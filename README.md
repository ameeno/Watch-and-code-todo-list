# Todo List Application (JS+DOM)

This Project is written in **javascript** with HTML and CSS elements for visual user interaction.


## Usage:

It can be deployed to a web server with javascript capability and stores all todo items on the users machine in the session file.


## Improvements

Cookie based server-side data storage, or cookie based salted hash to regenrate data on user load to recover old todo list items.

## Thank You.
